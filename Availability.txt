What is the difference between availability, fault-tolerance, and reliability?
How is availability measured using MTBF and MTTR? ​
What do the "9s" in availability measures represent, and how do they impact downtime?

If my system has 99.99% availability, does that mean it will never go down?
What’s the difference between a system that crashes completely and one that keeps running but gives wrong results?
If something breaks in my system, how does it know what to do next?
